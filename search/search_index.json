The infrastructure is available to all University personnel for their scientific work. The cluster can also be used by students within a scope of a thesis or a course. If your campus account is not yet activated for UBELIX, the User Guide might be a good place to get you started. UBELIX features a plethora of software and applications, which is outlined on the page Software, but the users are free to compile and install their own software within their home directories. If you are wondering... UBELIX is an acronym and stands for U niversity of Be rn Li nu x Cluster (Naming similarities to known Gauls are purely coincidental and not intended in any way). Acknowledging UBELIX When you present results generated using our cluster UBELIX, we kindly ask you to acknowledge the usage of the cluster. We would also highly appreciate if you could send us a copy of your papers, posters and presentations mentioning the UBELIX cluster. Public visibility of our cluster and documenting results are important for us to ensure long-term funding of UBELIX. Whenever the UBELIX infrastructure has been used to produce results used in a publication or poster, we kindly request citing the service in the acknowledgements: \"Calculations were performed on UBELIX (http://www.id.unibe.ch/hpc), the HPC cluster at the University of Bern.\" Press Kit Occasionally we are asked for images like diagrams illustrating the structure of UBELIX or even pictures of machines/storage or the like. Often this is due to the need to describe UBELIX within a research proposal. To support you with this, we provide a short text about UBELIX and some files to download. You can use all of this within your research proposal.

It describes the different hardware components that constitute the cluster and gives a quantitative list of the different generations of compute nodes in UBELIX. UBELIX (Acronym for U niversity of Be rn Li nu x Cluster) is a HPC cluster that currently consists of about 330 compute nodes featuring almost 6'300 CPU cores and 300'000 GPU cores and a software-defined storage infrastructure providing ~580 TB of disk storage net. UBELIX is a heterogeneous cluster, meaning UBELIX consists of different generations of compute nodes with different instruction sets. Compute nodes, front-end servers and the storage are interconnected through a high speed Infiniband network. The front-end servers also provide a link to the outside world. UBELIX is used by various institutes and research groups within chemistry, biology, physics, astronomy, computer science, geography, medical radiology and others for scientific research and by students working on their thesis.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"user-guide/index.html#description","text":"This page provides a high-level system overview of UBELIX.
