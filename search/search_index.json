The infrastructure is available to all University personnel for their scientific work. The cluster can also be used by students within a scope of a thesis or a course. If your campus account is not yet activated for UBELIX, the User Guide might be a good place to get you started. UBELIX features a plethora of software and applications, which is outlined on the page Software, but the users are free to compile and install their own software within their home directories. If you are wondering\u2026 UBELIX is an acronym and stands for U niversity of Be rn Li nu x Cluster (Naming similarities to known Gauls are purely coincidental and not intended in any way). Acknowledging UBELIX When you present results generated using our cluster UBELIX, we kindly ask you to acknowledge the usage of the cluster. We would also highly appreciate if you could send us a copy of your papers, posters and presentations mentioning the UBELIX cluster. Public visibility of our cluster and documenting results are important for us to ensure long-term funding of UBELIX.

However, many renderers \u2013 like Github\u2019s and Markdown Here \u2013 support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. Markdown Here supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the highlight.js demo page . Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it. Inline code has back-ticks around it. Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ``` , or are indented with four spaces.

But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>. Tables Tables aren\u2019t part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and Markdown Here supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email \u2013 a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.

Inline HTML You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it\u2019ll mostly work pretty well. Horizontal Rule Three or more... --- Hyphens *** Asterisks ___ Underscores Three or more\u2026 Hyphens Asterisks Underscores Line Breaks My basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover \u2013 hit <Enter> once (i.e., insert one newline), then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens. You\u2019ll soon learn to get what you want. \u201cMarkdown Toggle\u201d is your friend. Here are some things to try out: Here's a line for us to start with. This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*. This line is also a separate paragraph, but... This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*. Here\u2019s a line for us to start with. This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a separate paragraph . This line is also begins a separate paragraph, but\u2026 This line is only separated by a single newline, so it\u2019s a separate line in the same paragraph . YouTube Videos They can\u2019t be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE \" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg\" alt=\"IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" border=\"10\" /></a> Or, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border: [![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE) Referencing a bug by #bugID in your git commit links it to the slip. For example #1. Admonition !!! type \"optional explicit title within double quotes\" Any number of other indented markdown elements. This is the second paragraph. Some title Any number of other indented markdown elements. This is the second paragraph. And this is outside the admonition again. If you don\u2019t want a title, use a blank string \u201c\u201d. Don\u2019t do this at home! rST suggests the following \u201ctypes\u201d: attention, caution, danger, error, hint, important, note, tip, and warning: Some title This is type note Some title This is type hint Some title This is type tip Some title This is type important Some title This is type attention Some title This is type caution Some title This is type warning Some title This is type danger Some title This is type error Abbreviations The HTML specification is maintained by the W3C. *[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language *[W3C]: World Wide Web Consortium The HTML specification is maintained by the W3C .

It describes the different hardware components that constitute the cluster and gives a quantitative list of the different generations of compute nodes in UBELIX. UBELIX (Acronym for U niversity of Be rn Li nu x Cluster) is a HPC cluster that currently consists of about 330 compute nodes featuring almost 6\u2018300 CPU cores and 300\u2018000 GPU cores and a software-defined storage infrastructure providing ~580 TB of disk storage net. UBELIX is a heterogeneous cluster, meaning UBELIX consists of different generations of compute nodes with different instruction sets. Compute nodes, front-end servers and the storage are interconnected through a high speed Infiniband network. The front-end servers also provide a link to the outside world. UBELIX is used by various institutes and research groups within chemistry, biology, physics, astronomy, computer science, geography, medical radiology and others for scientific research and by students working on their thesis.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"user-guide/index.html#description","text":"This page provides a high-level system overview of UBELIX.
